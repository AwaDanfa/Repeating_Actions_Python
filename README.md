# Repeating_Actions_Python
 Repeating actions Python
""" 
Repeating an action multiple times is what computers are really good at!
For this task you have the chance to show what youâ€™ve learned about implementing repetition in code.
You are required to create a program that uses the while loop structure.
Write a program that always asks the user to enter a number.
When the user enters the negative number - 1, the program should stop requesting the user to enter a number.
The program must then calculate the average of the numbers entered excluding the - 1.
Make use of the while loop repetition structure to implement the program.
Use the trinket IDE below to write and test your code.
